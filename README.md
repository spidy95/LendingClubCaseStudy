## Conclusions
- Loans should be given to higher income customers
- In Nebraska, based on small dataset the recommendation is to not give loans.
- Since the years of experience has very little correlation with charge-off, it should be relatively low on evaluation scale.
- It is recommended that we retain low interest rates to recover the loans.
- It is recommended to avoid giving loans for starting small businesses.
